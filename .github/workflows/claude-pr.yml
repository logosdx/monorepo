            Please review this pull request according to our @logosdx project standards.

            Focus on:
            - TypeScript development standards (naming, error handling, function structure)
            - PNPM monorepo structure and package organization
            - Required dogfooding of utility usage (attempt, batch, circuitBreaker, etc.)
            - Code style conventions (newlines, comments, JSDoc)
            - Critical violations that require immediate attention
            - Security and performance considerations
            - Provide specific line references and actionable suggestions
            - Ensure proper import patterns (cross-package vs test imports)
